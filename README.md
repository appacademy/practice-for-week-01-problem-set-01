# Problem Set 01

These problems are to challenge your basic knowledge in working with strings,
booleans, integers and loops in various scenarios.

## Setup

1. Download this practice from GitHub.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `mocha` to run all specs.

## Instructions

Your goal is to solve each problem so that all specs are passing.

These problems entail the following challenges as the primary objectives:

- `whisper()`: string manipulation and interpolation.
- `isSubstring()`: string manipulation and search.
- `threeOrSeven()`: conditionals with integers and booleans.
- `sillyString()`: string manipulation and loops.
- `doubleLetterCount()`: loops with search and counting.

For additional tests that may help with debugging you can comment in
`console.log()` statements in each file, then run
`node <problem-relative-file-path>` in your terminal. For example,
`node problems/01-whisper.js`

You can run tests for specific problems with `mocha test/<problem-spec-file>`.
For example, `mocha test/01-whisper-spec.js`

## Submission

Once all of your specs are passing, prepare your work for submission:

1. Delete the __/node_modules__ folder.
2. Zip up the entire folder including code and specs.
3. Submit your zipped file.
